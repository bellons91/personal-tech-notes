## What is AI
### Augmented intelligence vs Artificial Intelligence

- **Augmented Intelligence**: help with tasks that are not practical to do. Examples: Screen readers. It allows humans to make the final decisions after they analyze data, reports, and other types of data.
- **Artificial Intelligence**: mimic human thinking. Do not require humans

- AI creates rules to complete a job
- ML builds the rules based on the examples provided;
- Deep Learning learns how to create rules given a huge dataset

### How AI performs calculations

- **Analysis**: ingest data and apply mathematical calculations
- **Prediction**: use data analysis to make predictions

### AI Levels

- **Narrow AI**: is focused on addressing a single task such as predicting your next purchase or planning your day. Examples: Siri, Alexa, Autonomous vehicles.
- **Broad AI**: more versatile than Narrow and can handle a wider range of related tasks. Broad AI is focused on integrating AI within a specific business process where companies need business- and enterprise-specific knowledge and data to train this type of system. Broad AI systems can perform functions such as predict global weather, trace pandemics, and help businesses predict future trends.
- **General AI**: refers to machines that can perform any intellectual task that a human can
