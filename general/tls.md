# TLS

TLS stands for Transport Layer Security, a protocol that provides secure communication over the internet. TLS encrypts the data that is sent and received between a client and a server, preventing eavesdropping, tampering, and impersonation. TLS also ensures that the client and the server can verify each other's identity using digital certificates. TLS is widely used for web browsing, email, instant messaging, voice over IP, and other applications that require privacy and authentication.
