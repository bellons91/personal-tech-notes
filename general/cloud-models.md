# Cloud Models

The cloud models define the deployment type of cloud resources.

## Private Cloud

It’s a cloud used by a single entity.

The IT department has almost full control of the cloud, and resources are not shared with other customers.

It has more costs.

It can be deployed on an on-site datacenter or delegated to a third-party vendor.

- Organizations have complete control over resources and security
- Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data
- Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance
- Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates

## Public cloud

Totally built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party provider.

Everyone can purchase services and resources, and the datacenter is shared.

- No capital expenditures to scale up
- Applications can be quickly provisioned and de-provisioned
- Organizations pay only for what they use
- Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security

## Hybrid cloud

You can have part of the cloud as private and expand it with public services (in case of immediate needs).

You can choose which services can be in the private cloud and which services can be public.

- Provides the most flexibility
- Organizations determine where to run their applications
- Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements

## Multi-cloud

You can use services from multiple cloud vendors, depending on your needs.
