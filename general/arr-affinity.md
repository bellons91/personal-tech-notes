# ARR Affinity

Application Request Routing (ARR) for IIS 7 and above is a proxy-based routing module that forwards HTTP requests to application servers based on HTTP headers, server variables, and load balance algorithms.

ARR cleverly identifies the user by assigning them a special cookie (known as an _affinity cookie_), which allows the service to choose the right instance the user was using to serve subsequent requests made by that user. This means, a client establishes a session with an instance and it will keep talking to the same instance until his session has expired.
