# Azure Functions

Azure Functions is an **event-driven**, **serverless** compute option that doesn't require maintaining virtual machines or containers.

With Azure Functions, an event wakes the function, alleviating the need to keep resources provisioned when there are no events.

Since the function runs only after an event is triggered and then all the resources are deallocated, you only **pay for the CPU time** used by the function.

Azure Functions supports **triggers**, which are ways to start the execution of your code, and **bindings**, which are ways to simplify coding for input and output data.

## Use cases

- you don't care about the underlying infrastructure;
- you have to respond to an event;
- the work will take not more than a few seconds;
- you need **automatic scalability**;

## Functions timeout

The `functionTimeout` property in the `host.json` project file specifies the timeout duration for functions in a function app. This property applies specifically to function executions. After the trigger starts function execution, the function needs to return/respond within the timeout duration.

## Required storage account

On any plan, a function app requires a general [[azure-storage-account]], which supports Azure Blob, Queue, Files, and Table storage. This is because **Functions rely on Azure Storage for operations such as managing triggers and logging function executions**, but some storage accounts don't support queues and tables.

The same storage account used by your function app can also be used by your triggers and bindings to store your application data. However, for storage-intensive operations, you should use a separate storage account.

## Scaling

In the **Consumption and Premium plans**, Azure Functions scales CPU and memory resources by adding more instances of the Functions host. The number of instances is determined by the number of events that trigger a function.

**Each instance of the Functions host in the Consumption plan is limited to 1.5 GB of memory and one CPU.** An instance of the host is the entire function app, meaning all functions within a function app share resources within an instance and scale at the same time. Function apps that share the same Consumption plan scale independently.

In the Premium plan, the plan size determines the available memory and CPU for all apps in that plan on that instance.

**Function code files are stored on Azure Files shares on the function's main storage account**. When you delete the main storage account of the function app, the function code files are deleted and can't be recovered.

The **Scale Controller** is the component that monitors the rate of events and determines whether to scale out or scale in, using **heuristics** for each trigger type.

When there are no functions running within a function app, the number of instances can scale to zero. Then, the first request has a bit of latency because the function app must scale to one. This latency is called **cold start**.

![Scale Controller](azure-functions/azure-functions-scale-controller.png)

Even though a function app can scale out to a max of 200 instances, a single instance can process more requests at a time, so there isn't a hard limit on the number of concurrent executions.

For HTTP triggers, new instances are allocated, at most, once per second. For non-HTTP triggers, new instances are allocated, at most, once every 30 seconds.

You may need to define a limit to the maximum number of instances. You can define a value for the `functionAppScaleLimit` configuration:

- `0` or `null` to have an unrestricted number of instances;
- `1` to the max number of instances depending on the Plan (200 for Consumption, 100 for Premium).

## Development

A **function** is made of:

- the code, which can be written in many languages;
- the configs, stored in the `function.json` file;

Some notes about the `function.json` file:

- It is automatically generated for compiled languages, using the annotations written in the function code;
- Must be created manually for scripted languages;
- Contains a node named `bindings` which contains the **trigger**, the **bindings**, and configuration settings. **Each function has exactly one trigger**, but can have other bindings.

The `function.json` file has this shape:

```json
{
  "disabled": false,
  "bindings": [
    // ... bindings here
    {
      "type": "bindingType",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "myParamName"
      // ... more depending on binding
    }
  ]
}
```

The _bindings_ node contains both the trigger and the other bindings. Each item requires at least these settings:

- `type`: name of the binding/trigger;
- `direction`: indicates whether the binding is for receiving data into the function or sending data from the function. For example, `in` or `out`.
- `name`: name used for the binding.

Functions are grouped in a Function App. The Function App has some other configurations stored in the `host.json` file, which contains runtime-specific configurations.

Starting version 2.x, **all functions in a function app must use the same programming language**.

Triggers and bindings let you avoid hardcoding access to other services. Your function receives data (for example, the content of a queue message) in function parameters. You send data (for example, to create a queue message) by using the return value of the function.

Triggers:

- exactly one per function;
- can have associated data (a payload)
- the direction is always _in_

[[aggiungi tipi di trigger]]

Bindings:

- allow you to connect to other resources;
- can be _input bindings_ or _output bindings_;
- optional
- a function might have one or multiple input and/or output bindings
- some bindings have a _inout_ direction.
- as output binding, you can use the return value of the function.

Example of _function.json_ file with both input and output bindings:

```js
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "order",
      "queueName": "myqueue-items",
      "connection": "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
    },
    {
      "type": "table",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "$return",
      "tableName": "outTable",
      "connection": "MY_TABLE_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING"
    }
  ]
}
```

Which, in C# can be expressed as

```cs
#r "Newtonsoft.Json"

using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

// From an incoming queue message that is a JSON object, add fields and write to Table storage
// The method return value creates a new row in Table Storage
public static Person Run(JObject order, ILogger log)
{
    return new Person() {
            PartitionKey = "Orders",
            RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            Name = order["Name"].ToString(),
            MobileNumber = order["MobileNumber"].ToString() };
}

public class Person
{
    public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
    public string RowKey { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string MobileNumber { get; set; }
}
```

or, in a class library, you can define triggers and binding using C# attributes:

```cs
public static class QueueTriggerTableOutput
{
    [FunctionName("QueueTriggerTableOutput")]
    [return: Table("outTable", Connection = "MY_TABLE_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING")]
    public static Person Run(
        [QueueTrigger("myqueue-items", Connection = "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING")]JObject order,
        ILogger log)
    {
        return new Person() {
                PartitionKey = "Orders",
                RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
                Name = order["Name"].ToString(),
                MobileNumber = order["MobileNumber"].ToString() };
    }
}

public class Person
{
    public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
    public string RowKey { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string MobileNumber { get; set; }
}
```

Notice that **the Connection value refers to a configuration key, and does not contain the real connection string**. The default configuration provider uses environment variables that are set in Application Settings when running in the Azure Functions service, or from the local settings file when developing locally.

## Identity-based connections

Some functions may require the use of an identity instead of a secret:

- Identity-based connections use a Managed Identity;
- Identity-based connections are _not_ supported by Durable Functions;
- By default, it uses the system-assigned identity. However, you can specify `credential` and `clientID` to use a user-assigned identity;
- When developing locally, the developer identity is used.
- Done by assigning a role in [[azure-rbac]] or specifying the identity in an access policy, depending on the service to which you're connecting
