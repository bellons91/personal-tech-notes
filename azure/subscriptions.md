# Azure Subscriptions

Subscriptions are a unit of management, billing, and scale.

A subscription provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services. In fact, to create a subscription you need an Azure AD account.

You can use Azure subscriptions to define boundaries around Azure products, services, and resources.

Subscriptions are a way to organize [[resource-groups]] and apply consistent policies.
