# Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

AKS is a container **orchestration** service.

It allows you to manage the lifecicle of a container.

It supports direct access to the Kubernetes API and runs any Kubernetes workload. The full cluster resides in your subscription, with the cluster configurations and operations within your control and responsibility.
