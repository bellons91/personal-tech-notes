# Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) calculator

It helps you compare the costs of running an on-premises infrastructure compared to an Azure infrastructure.

You enter the details of the current on-prem infrastructure (and the related requirements) and get an estimation of the costs of having the same infrastructure on Azure.

It also takes into consideration the IT labour costs.
