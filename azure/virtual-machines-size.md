# Virtual Machines size

You can choose the size of a Virtual machine. The bigger the size, the higher the costs.

If you move from one level to the next one, you **double the costs**. Similarly, if you move to the previous one, you cut the costs in half.

Picking the correct [[azure-virtual-machines]] size helps you to [[optimize-virtual-machines]].
