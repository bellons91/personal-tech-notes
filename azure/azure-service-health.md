# Azure Service Health

Azure Service Health helps you keep track of Azure resources, both your specifically deployed resources and the overall status of Azure.

## Azure Status

Azure Status watches for the global status of Azure.

It helps identify global outages across all Azure regions.

## Service Health

Service Health includes the status of all the services and regions you are using.

Useful to learn about outages, maintenance, and other stuff that may impact the services you are using.

After an outage, Service Health provides official incident reports called **root cause analysis (RCA)**, which you can share with stakeholders.

## Resource Health

Service Health includes the status of all the individual resources you are using.

You can configure alerts to notify you in case of issues with your resources.
