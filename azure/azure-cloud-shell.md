# Azure Cloud Shell

Azure Cloud Shell is a **browser-based shell** tool that allows you to create, configure, and manage Azure resources using a shell.

You can choose to use [[azure-powershell]] or [[azure-cli]].

It is accessible once you have logged in to Azure Portal. Therefore, you **are already authenticated**.
