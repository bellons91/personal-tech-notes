# Azure Entra Identity Protection

Azure Entra Identity Protection is a comprehensive solution that helps you protect your organization's identities and detect and respond to potential identity-related risks.

One of its features is the ability to configure **risk-based policies**. In this case, you can set up a risk-based policy that triggers a password change prompt for users when they connect to Azure AD via the internet from an unidentified IP address. This helps enhance security by encouraging users to change their passwords in case of suspicious activity.
