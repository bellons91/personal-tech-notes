# Azure Entra External Identities

Azure Entra External Identities is a service that allows you to interact with users outside your organization (therefore called _external identities_).

External Identities look similar to SSO since they allow using a single identity (but coming from external systems) to work with your internal organization. Such external systems can be:

- social accounts: Google, Facebook, Twitter
- another corporate account
- personal credentials

External Identities allow for **B2B collaboration**, letting external users be part of your directory, marked as _guests_.

When connecting with another Azure Entra organization, you can use **B2B direct connect**, allowing guests to be part of Teams channels as guest users.
