# Azure CosmosDB Item

An Azure Cosmos DB item can represent either a document in a collection, a row in a table, or a node or edge in a graph. It all depends on the API you are using.

Items can have arbitrary schemas in the same container, and they are indexed automatically without using explicit indexes.
