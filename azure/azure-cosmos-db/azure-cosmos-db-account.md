# Azure Cosmos DB Account

The Azure Cosmos DB account is the fundamental unit of global distribution and high availability.
Your Azure Cosmos DB account contains a **unique DNS name**.

You can create a **maximum of 50 Azure Cosmos DB accounts under an Azure subscription** (this is a soft limit that can be increased via support request).

After you create an account under your Azure subscription, you can manage the data in your account by creating databases, containers, and items.

[[azure-cosmos-db-consistency-levels]] are defined for the whole Account.
