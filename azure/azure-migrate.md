# Azure Migrate Service

Azure Migrate is a service that helps you migrate your data from an on-premises environment to the cloud.

It provides a single point to start, run, and track the data migration with Azure.

It provides some tools for assesment and migration.

Here's the list of tools:

- **Azure Migrate: Discovery and assessment.** Discover and assess on-premises servers running on VMware, Hyper-V, and physical servers in preparation for migration to Azure.
- **Azure Migrate: Server Migration.** Migrate VMware VMs, Hyper-V VMs, physical servers, other virtualized servers, and public cloud VMs to Azure.
- **Data Migration Assistant.** Data Migration Assistant is a stand-alone tool to **assess SQL Servers**. It helps pinpoint potential problems blocking migration. It identifies unsupported features, new features that can benefit you after migration, and the right path for database migration.
- **Azure Database Migration Service.** Migrate on-premises databases to Azure VMs running SQL Server, Azure SQL Database, or SQL Managed Instances.
- **Azure App Service migration assistant.** Azure App Service migration assistant is a standalone tool to assess on-premises websites for migration to Azure App Service. Use Migration Assistant to migrate .NET and PHP web apps to Azure.
- **Azure Data Box.** Use Azure Data Box products to move large amounts of offline data to Azure.
