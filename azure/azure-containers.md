# Azure Containers

Containers are a virtualization environment. You can run multiple containers on a single physical or virtual host.

Containers are lighter weight than [[azure-virtual-machines]], and allow for easier scaling and creation.

There are several ways to use containers in Azure:

![[azure-container-instances]]

![[azure-container-apps]]

![[azure-kubernetes-service]]
